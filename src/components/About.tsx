        <p className="para">
          I'm an MSc Data Science student at Cardiff University with a
          background in backend engineering from my experience at Tata
          Consultancy Services. I've worked on REST APIs, batch processing
          systems, and production-level applications, which shaped my approach
          to building reliable and structured systems.
        </p>
        <p className="para">
          Alongside my studies, I work as a Residence Life Assistant, where I
          support students and help organise community events, strengthening my
          communication and teamwork skills.
        </p>
        <p className="para">
          I work with Java, Python, SQL, and backend frameworks like Spring
          Boot. I build machine learning models and data pipelines, from
          forecasting on 20M+ records to deploying models in web apps. I enjoy
          solving problems methodically and building systems that are
          practical and efficient.
